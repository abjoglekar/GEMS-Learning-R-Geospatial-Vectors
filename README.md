# Geocomputation with Vector Data in R

Welcome to **GEMS X003.2 Explicitly Accounting for Location in Agriculture: Geocomputation with Vector Data in R**. This course is designed for those who are interested in learning some basic geocomputation applications on vector data. Through this course, you will learn how to manipulate vector objects and conduct basic operations, such as merging, subsetting, aggregation, spatial joins, determining centroids and calculating buffers, etc. You will have the opportunity to immediately practice your new skills via hands-on exercises focused on agri-food applications throughout the 2-hour workshop.   

This workshop is part of a 5-module series on working with and analyzing spatial agricultural data in R.  

## Prerequisites: 
GEMSx003.1 or equivalent  


## Class Setup
1. Login to GEMS Platform at https://gems.agroinformatics.org/webui/#
    - GEMS Platform uses Globus to authenticate your account, so if your institution is already linked to Globus (for example, University of Minnesota and many other universities), you can search and select your institution from the list and use your institutional account to log into GEMS Platform. Alternatively, you can log in using Google or ORCID iD, or create  your own Globus account to log in.   

1. Once logged in, click `Analyze > JupyterLab` from the homepage

1. Open a bash terminal by clicking 'Terminal' icon in the Launcher **OR** by clicking `File > New > Terminal`

1. In bash terminal, create directories for this class  
    ```shell
    mkdir classes  
    cd classes  
    mkdir GEMSX003  
    cd GEMSX003
    ```  
1. Clone repository for this classes  
    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/abjoglekar/GEMS-Learning-R-Geospatial-Vectors.git
    ```

## Class and Exercises
In your JupyterLab environment, open the newly cloned directory `GEMS-Learning-R-Geospatial-Vectors` and then open `x003_Module2_Vector.ipynb` to follow along for the lecture and in-class exercises.
